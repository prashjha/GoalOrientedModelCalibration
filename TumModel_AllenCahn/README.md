# Allen-Cahn dynamic problem (section 4.2 in Jha and Oden JCP 2022)

## plot_calibration_results.ipynb
Collects MCMC samples from all chains and plots various results

Results and plots corresponding to `run_6.py` in `run_6` directory are used in the article. 

## run_1.ipynb
For testing and developing sampling scripts.

## to test the compute time, `run_6` settings were used in this script `test_compute_time_single_forward_run.py`

Nonlinear solve in 					403.67  s
Linear error solve in 			96.57   s
